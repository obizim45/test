   <p> Hello my name is Olivie Bizimana, I'm currently a Syracuse University Student. I'm attending the University for the major of Information Management and technology with Two Concentrations of information Security and Data Analytics. I took a liking to the major because of its advancement capability and also because tech is the new future. </p> <br>

<p> So far since attending syracuse i've learned multiple programming languages such as Python, SQL, R & R studio, HTML, CSS, and a touch of javascript.i've worked on a few project, so far i've done statistical Analytics on a electricity consumptions for an entire neighborhood using R, i've made a python recommendation program for places to visit which also included things such as sentiment analysis, weather data, location API’S, and even ratings of the places nearby. I've created a website using HTML & CSS a while back as well.  I've spent the past summer studying for the COMP TIA A+ Certification exam and I'm hoping to also get the Security + Certificate as well. <p><br>

Surprisingly, my hometown is Syracuse, NY. As far as hobbies go I play basketball extensively and I also enjoy going to the gym a lot. I have a broad range of favorite tv shows genres. Those may include but are not limited to Breaking Bad, Prison Break, Money Heist, SmallVille, SuperNatural, The Vampire Diaries etc….
